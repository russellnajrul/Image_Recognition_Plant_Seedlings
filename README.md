# Image_Recognition_Plant_Seedlings
Convolutional Neural Network is applied on a dataset containing images of unique plants of 12 different species. Dropout, data augmentation and batch normalization were used as regularization techniques. Data Augmentation worked better as a regularizer, and generated 86 percent accuracy on test data to detect plants.
